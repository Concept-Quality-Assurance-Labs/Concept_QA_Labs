                    <p>CMMI® model integrates Software, Systems, Integrated Process and Product development, Supplier Sources into a coherence model. The model’s version 1.1 is released in early 2001 by SEI and is being currently adopted by industry globally. The advantage of CMMI® over SW CMMI® for software industry is the present CMMI® model is also having improvements made over existing SW CMMI® version 1.1 (includes SW CMMI® draft 2.0).</p>

                    » Improve/develop processes to address the gaps.
                    » Provide necessary trainings on processes and related software / system engineering areas Institutionalize the process.

        <p>SCAMPI A (Standard CMMI Appraisal method for process improvements) is CMMI appraisal method. SCAMPI is developed by SEI and there are three variants of method (SCAMPI A, SCAMPI B and SCAMPI C). Through SCAMPI A the organization’s maturity or capability levels could be determined (along with process improvement opportunities) and SCAMPI B and SCAMPI C are less rigorous and primarily focus on finding out process improvement opportunities or to find gaps in the present processes.SCAMPI methods are presently being used globally for performing internal appraisals for process improvements. SEI also maintains an appraiser program, and through extensive training authorizes individuals to perform SCAMPI across through SEI Transition partners. SEI also maintains a list of active lead appraisers and the list is accessible to all from SEI website.</p>
